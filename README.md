#### Parts of the Game:

* The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
* The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
* If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
* The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

#### How to Guide:

The game board consists of 16 cards arranged in a deck. The deck is made up of 8 pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side.

* A user must select 2 cards at a time.
* Mismatched cards will be turned over, and the user must select a new pair of cards.
* Once all 8 pairs are matched, the user is prompted to play again.
* The moves are depending on how many moves are made.

#### Issues/Planned Changes/Roadmap:

The main issue with my game is that the timer is not working. The player cannot open three cards together in one turn. I am trying to add timer and shuffle option in this game.
